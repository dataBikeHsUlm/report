\section{Conclusion}
This report presents in overall a model of a machine learning pipeline, this data science method can be applied in every domain since it provides a structured way to extract meaningful information out of a huge raw amount of data.
We started as team of four members,  we get initially ourselves acquainted with the different required technologies which were mostly unfamiliar to us. We afterwards set up the hardware, then processed, profiled and scraped the data. Finally, we applied machine learning regression algorithms to make predictions.
More members joined our group afterwards, which made us think of new tasks and thus new ways to extend the project scope. 
This project was started from scratch and the results discussed previously were of course limited to our initial prediction goal.  This means that it's still open to a lot of enhancements, especially from new members with fresh ideas about extracting new meaningful information out of the current data.
This report presented  for us  a new way of collaboration in a group, for some of us it was more importantly an incentive to delve and specialize in this area in future works.
