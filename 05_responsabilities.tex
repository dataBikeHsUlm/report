\section{Responsibilities}

Within Scrum the team is self-organizing and cross-functional. This means that every
team member can choose tasks fitting his knowledge base as well as his preferences
and interests. Hence everyone was free to suggest and accept the tasks he liked
most.
It turned out that the team leads a very good self-organization because
everyone of us has a specific interest and knowledge according to the tasks of
the project.
Therefore Anass Khaldi was responsible to install the Nominatim server
and it's components. In the second sprint his main part was to research Django
and how we can display maps on our web application. In the third sprint it was
his responsibility to install graphhopper and to fix the according issues as well
as issues of Hadoop.
The main part of the Jupyter notebook to research nominatim functions like compute
centroids, compute distances by route and doing all in bulk was done by Guillaume
Goni. In the second sprint he created all GitHub repositories for storing our work.
He wrote the script to initialize the database as well as the one to fill the database.
Therefore he researched for best ways to collect zip codes and find the solution
in the PostgresDB. Moreover he prepared a tutorial about Django for the rest of
the team members.
As mentioned before Kathi Rodi took over the role of the Scrum Master, hence it
was her responsibility to ensure that the scrum artifacts were kept as well as
correspond with the Product Owners. Apart from her tasks as a Scrum Master she
was responsible to provide a box for collaborating with all needed documents like
templates for daily scrums, sprint plannings, reviews, retrospectives and tracking
the working hours. Furthermore she created the presentation for every sprint.
Moreover she solved several tasks like create Jupyter notebooks for geocode,
reverse geocoding and compute distances as the crow flies, create the ER model,
install the MySQL database and to research for Graphhopper.
In the end it was her responsibility to write a project report and add the task 
descriptions of the team members to it.\\Pascal Riedel was responsible for research,
document and compare the different Hadoop distributions. With the help of his
weightened comparison table we could take the decision for one specific distribution.
It was also his part to install the \acs{hdp} as well as to implement a Map Reduce job.
During the first project phase he solved several issues according to \acs{hdp}.
Furthermore he was responsible for the data profiling part and to create associated
Zepellin notebooks.

found in attachment~\ref{resp}.
