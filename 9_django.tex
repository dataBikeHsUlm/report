\section{Django}\label{sec:django}

For our frontend web application, we will use \textbf{Django} as it works in python and is the most used.
Since we only have a limited amount of time working on the project we decided to do expert based learning on Django. This means only one of us will research for the usage and implementation of Django to subsequently teach his findings to the team. 
Therefore Guillaume Goni wrote a recapitulative document for the rest of the team, so everyone could quickly get ready to work on the server code.
It is mostly inspired by the official tutorial of Django \citep{Djangodocumentation2019} and from the Django documentation \citep{Django2019}.\\
Due to the lack of time it wasn't`t already possible to implement the WebApp using the Django framework. This will be part of the next sprint.
