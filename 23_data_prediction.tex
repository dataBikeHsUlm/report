\section{Data Prediction with MLPRegressor}
As we wanted to train a non-linear model we decided to use a Multi-layer Perceptron since it can learn a non-linear function approximator for either classification or regression. However  a \acf{mlp} uses backpropagation which is the most widely used algorithm for supervised learning with multi-layered feed-forward networks \cite{riedmiller1993direct} this algorithm was implemented to train a prediction model for the rental bike usage on a daily base.
