\section{Introduction}

No matter in which area you move there is a huge chance that data science will be there too. It is one of the fast moving trends during the last years which is caused by the unimaginable amount of data we produce everyday. We could gain a lot of knowledge out of this data, but therefore we must analyze it. That is when data science comes into play. But with the help of data science we can not just analyze the past we can also predict the future.\\\\
Let's say we have a bike rental station which provides to rent bikes for a certain amount of time. We track the duration of the rental, the time of rental, the routes the bikes rode and lot more information. By processing all this data it is possible to predict the future usage of the bikes and the most frequented routes to specific times.
That is what the main goal of this project represents. This project report deals with tasks which can be summarized by \emph{preparatory steps} to reach this final goal. The project duration is divided into two semesters. The tasks of the first part will be discussed in this paper.
